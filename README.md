# CTF-Writeups
> Capture The Flag Writeups from UiA-CTF team members.


## How to write a CTF Writeup 
- Try to retrace the steps you did to solve the task. 
  - Like the thought process and what you tried in order to solve the task, 
- Try to make a rough sketch of what you did and what you tried, and how you progressed to the answer of the task
- Remember to give everyone who helped in solving the task credit (if they provided helpful insigth in solving the task)

## What should be in the writeup.
-   The task analysis with clear explanations for what you found, don't assume something is "obvious" (because it might not be)
-   Explain the task itself, so that someone without in-depth knowledge of the challenge can also understand the idea
-   Include intermediate steps, eg. for crypto don't just write we arrive at equation XYZ, but actually provide the calculations
-   Include code snippets and examples/sanity checks for intermediate steps to "show" what is going on
-   The writeup should be in proper order, so it can be followed
